# hello-world
A first foray into using GitHub repositories

Hello GitHub Community!

My name is Zachary, and I'm learning all that I can to begin my journey into coding and becoming a programmer.
I like working with puzzles and learning how things work down to their individual parts. 
Coding is a way for me to always find a new challenge and learn new skills with the goal of turning it into a career.
